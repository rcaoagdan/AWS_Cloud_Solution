# Deliverable
## Conflict Plan
* Team conflict resolution process:
     * Majority rules, team vote as needed. Team members agree to approach each other with a respectful tone. Any conflicts that can't be resolved internally will be brought to our class instructor. 
* Team contribution issues:
     * If any member of the team feels like the other isn't contributing then we bring it up and have a group discussion about it. Last step would be to take it outside the group to our class instructor. 
* Conflict escalation policy:
     * If the group can't resolve the issue internally through open and transparent discussion, then the issue will get escalated to our instructor. 

## Communication Plan
* Office hours:
     * Zoom for team meeting space between the hours of 5 PM - Midnight (as needed) during the week and Slack for sharing content. Specific team meeting time will be scheduled as needed.
* After hours:
     * Team members will communicate via Slack after hours (defined as before 6:30 PM or after 9:30 PM).
     * Responses are not expected after hours to respect each other's time.
* Strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard:
     * Ensure every team member is in agreement before moving forward. Ensure every member has the opportunity to provide their input and take on / lead tasks as needed. 

## Work Plan
* Describe how you will identify tasks:
     * Identify tasks as a team based on the challenge provided.
     * Map project expectations to the identified tasks.
     * Create assignments to each team member based on the project mapping above.     
* Describe how you will know when tasks are complete: 
     * Team member walks rest of team through solution     
     * Team provides input for improvement or clarity    
     * Test completed task for functionality
* Describe how you will manage work in general:
     * We will track project completion in distinct stages via a project management tool (Trello)
     * Stages: In progress, Submitted for review, Reviewed, Ready for release
* Project management tool:
     * Trello 

## Git Process
* Project components on GitHub:
     * All project components (where applicable) will reside in a shared GitHub repository.  
* Repository sharing:
     * All team members are members of the repository with full access.  
* Git flow:
     * Each team member clones the repo to a local repository as needed and then adds, commits, and pushes updated content.
